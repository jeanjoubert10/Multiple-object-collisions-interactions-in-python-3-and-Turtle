# Multiple-object-collisions-interactions-in-python-3-and-Turtle
Simple program with multiple object collisions/interactions in Python 3 and Turtle
 
 This is just a simple program - I am working up to a program based on momentum of each particle but this is only a first 
 attempt to take care of simple interactions/collisions.
